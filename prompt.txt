So my friend. I ve got a task to do and you should be the one helping me to perform it. I want to write a python project with oop. I have already implemented some of the parts in single scripts but I want to have it more coordinated and readable with classes and methods etc. The project is about doing a gait parameter calculation on videos, where I have keypoint data from human pose estimation models. I use alphapose and openpose coordiantes. Now functions I want the whole code project to have are:
- Read json data of openpose and alphapose and put it into a useable format and save it as csv. 
- Then I want to preprocess the data as good as possible before calculating angles. 
- For the preprocessing steps include reindexing or tracking the right person in the video. Here I want to first have an algorithm, that does it as good as possible and in the next step I want to have a kind of tool where I can make some manual adjustments to make sure the right person is tracked and change it interactively in a window where I maybe see a plot of a specific trajectory and a visualization of the keypoints on the videoframes. 
- Then in the next step I want to catch other outliers like leg swaps or if a marker just isn't tracked correctly I may delete and interpolate it. First I want to do it automated where I use some kind of algorithm to detect outlier, delete and interpolate them. Then I want to have a tool again, where I can search for outliers again, like before with the reindexing, with a video visualization and a plot of a trajectory
